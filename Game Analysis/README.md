# Overview

In this project I will be working in GCP and more specifically, working with Python and SQL to create two simple ETL scripts to extract and transform raw data to more querable format, and then do some analysis on the matchStart event.

The project is divided into three parts, the first two parts where I create two simple ETL scripts to extract and transform raw data to more querable format, you can access them from [HERE](https://deepnote.com/viewer/github/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/Game%20Analysis/Game%20Analysis.ipynb)
The third part where I do some analysis on the matchStart event, you can access it from [HERE](https://deepnote.com/viewer/github/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/Game%20Analysis/Assignment3.ipynb)
