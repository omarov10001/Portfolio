# Determining The Best Location For a High-End Gym In The City Of Helsinki,Finland , Using Clustering Approach

In this project I used K-means clustering approach to determine the optimal location to open high-end  gym in Helsinki,depending on the following factors :

* Median income among inhabitants
* Population density
* Proportion of people between the ages of 18 to 39
* Concentration of public transportation stations
* Concentration of pre-existing gyms

Population-related data was obtained from the Tilastokeskus (or Statistics Finland) . Tilastokeskus is a Finnish governmental agency that annually publishes census and other types of data pertaining to Finland at the country, municipal, and neighborhood levels ,View the data from [HERE](https://github.com/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/Hel_Gym/HelsinkiData.xlsx),Venue-related data was obtained using the Foursquare API
