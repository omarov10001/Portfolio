# SQL Cohort Analysis for Wolt Delveries 

## Project Overview 

Customer retention can be described as a way to look at how engaged and loyal customers are, that is, whether they continue using the service after their first purchase.
In this Project we want to see how well Wolt manages to retain its customers month after month based on when users made their first ever purchase.

## About the data

The data consists of two files:

* first_purchases.xlsx ,you can access it from [HERE](https://github.com/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Wolt%20Customer%20retention/first_purchases.xlsx)
* purchases.xlsx ,you can access it from [HERE](https://github.com/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Wolt%20Customer%20retention/purchases.xlsx)

The data is an artificial dataset that could be produced by Wolt purchase process, where a user makes their first and possibly following purchases from Wolt.
These purchases have been separated into two files, the first one containing only the usersâ€™ first ever purchases from Wolt, and the second one containing all purchases
from these users.

## Objectives

Create visualizations showing the monthly customer retention per product line to communicate the following:

* Cohort based monthly retention for Retail product line
* Cohort based monthly retention for Restaurant product line

## SQL Query 

* The Query aim  is to get table with 4 columns cohort month , cohort size , month number in the relation of the cohort 
month and percentage of customer retention of that month 
* I Separated the users depending of the product line 
* View the SQL query where the product line is  "Retaurant" from [HERE](https://github.com/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Wolt%20Customer%20retention/SQLRest.sql)
* View the SQL query where the product line is  "Retail store" from [HERE](https://github.com/omarov10001/Portfolio/blob/main/SQL%20Wolt%20Customer%20retention/SQLRetail.sql)

The result of the SQL query looks like this
