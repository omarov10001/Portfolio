    "# Tracking App featuring in App Store and Google Play \n",

    "![alt text](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/app-store-games-collection-apple-ipad-air-kiev-ukraine-june-brand-new-modern-white-featured-mobile-apps-41828259.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Launching a game globally is not something you get to see often these days, the product has to go through lot before it qualifies to go globally, after launching globally everyone in the game team is interested to see how good is the game performing and how happy with the game are the two main stores, App store and google play. These stores have criteria that might be not always clear on how featuring happens, this criteria includes; optimal crash rates, live events and many other factors that we know and some that we don't know. In this notebook we will track featuring for imaginary game using artificial data and come out with results that will help us improve our product\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Problem to solve \n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking of Featuring placements on the stores is usually done using external tools like App figures.com, these are usually helpful but not enough because\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Difficulty in granting access to all team members, since usually these tools charge per specific users numbers**\n",
    "* **Limited functionality and non-flexible charts/tables, in case of app figures you can't access the featuring data for custom periods other than what the website has**\n",
    "* **Putting all the data of the product in the same place makes it easier to do analysis and come up with conclusions to take actions**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.Methodology \n",
    "\n",
    "I will call Appfigures API using python script, this script will be scheduled to run daily. Then this data will be cleaned and wrangled and sent to BigQuery as table in dataset then this data will be visualised using data studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources\n",
    "In this notebook I'll be calling appfigures API for the purpose of showing code only NOT using the real data. The data that will be used in the visualization and analysis is 100% fake data that I personally made to mimic real product senario. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Cleaning \n",
    "Part of the data wrangling/cleaning will be done using Pandas library to map the data needed from the JSON file we get from AppFigures API, part of the data wrangling/cleaning will be done in BigQuery\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualization\n",
    "Google data studio (Looker studio) will be used to build the dashboard after putting the data to BQ \n",
